# Developing the plugin

This article provides information about how to build, package, or run the plugin locally. For usage information, see the Jenkins plugin [tutorial][tutorial].

The plugin provides two functionalities:  

* Provision permanent agents in MacStadium - Via `Manage Jenkins` -> `Manage Nodes`
* Provision ephemeral agents in MacStadium - Via `Manage Jenkins` -> `Configure System` -> `Add a new cloud`

## Build requirements

* [Maven 3][maven]
* JDK 8

## Building, packaging and testing the plugin

To build the plugin, run:  

    mvn install

This runs [checkstyle][checkstyle] validation and builds the plugin.

To package the plugin, run:

    mvn package

This runs checkstyle validation, build and package the plugin.
It produces an `hpi` file located in the `target` folder.

To run tests, run:

    mvn test

To run checkstyle, run:

    mvn validate

## Running the plugin locally

To use the plugin locally, run:

    mvn hpi:run

This boots a Jenkins master, package the plugin and install it. To run the Jenkins master open http://localhost:8080.
